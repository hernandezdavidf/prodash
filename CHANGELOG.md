# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are logged here, newest entry on top.

## 2026-08-12 — Drop sleep tracking, move Shift timeline left

- Removed the Sleep card entirely, along with the "Sleep 7d avg" header stat, the
  7-day average, the debt-vs-7h figure and the bar chart.
- **Shift timeline** moved into that slot — top of the narrow left column. Its
  time column was retuned for the tighter width (84px, no-wrap: the widest label
  "12:15pm–12:45pm" needs 78px flat, so anything less went ragged over two lines).
  The appointment form now stacks onto two rows to fit.
- Removed the code that went with it: `renderSleep()`, `sleepSeries()`,
  `sleepAvg()`, `SLEEP_TARGET`, the input listener, the header line, the
  low-sleep-average nudge and ~13 rules of orphaned CSS.

**Kept on purpose:** the "Slept 5+ hours" non-negotiable, the 7:00–12:15 Sleep
block in the timeline, and its "this is your sleep window" nudge. Any `sleepHrs`
already recorded in `S.log` is left untouched, so restoring the card later would
pick the history back up.

## 2026-08-12 — Back to DayFlow, now "How's our Dave looking? · ProDash"

David preferred DayFlow over the v8 rebuild, so DayFlow is now the daily app.
`dashboard.html` (v8) stays as the reference to port features from.

**Brought under version control.** `dayflow.html` copied from
`00 - EVESYS\Schedule and Tasks\` and committed byte-identical before any edit.
The original stays there untouched as a fallback. Both point at the same
`dayflow-data.json` in OneDrive, so no data migration was needed.

**Renamed** to "How's our Dave looking?" with a "Productivity Dashboard (ProDash)"
subtitle.

**Stronger palette.** Green/blue/yellow/orange at full saturation replacing the
muted earth tones. Conduent blue, CMIT sky, AFC indigo, My Company green,
Learning yellow, HOA slate. Orange became the single attention colour — nudges,
streaks, now-marker, ageing tasks — and is deliberately never a lane, so orange
always means "look here". Variable names were kept, so 150 lines of CSS didn't
need rewriting.

**Dark mode** with an auto/dark/light toggle, persisted in `S.theme` so the
choice syncs through the data file to other PCs. This required splitting tokens
that were doing double duty as both a fill and as text on that fill
(`--forest`/`--forest-ink`, `--night`/`--night-ink`, `--ivory`/`--on-brand`,
`--terra`/`--terra-ink`/`--on-warm`) — a hue dark enough to carry white text is
too dark to *be* text on a dark card. Lane colours moved into CSS variables so a
theme switch re-tints every dot and bar with no re-render.

**Appointments with real times.** The schedule blocks were hardcoded in source,
so booking a dentist appointment was impossible. Added `S.events`, merged with
the recurring backbone by `dayBlocks()`. Must-attend appointments raise a nudge
within 2 hours. Inline add row, delete with an ×.

**Fixed:** the schedule had no day-of-week awareness, so Conduent, CMIT and AFC
rendered on Saturdays and Sundays. Weekends now show only Sleep, Wake + prep and
Dinner.

**Verification:** 162 text elements measured at ≥4.5:1 contrast in both themes.
Console hooks `dfDebug.dayBlocks(date)` and `dfDebug.state()` added for testing.

## 2026-08-12 — Productivity Dashboard v8

Built `dashboard.html`, a single standalone file that opens by double-clicking and works
offline. Replaces the earlier `dayflow.html`, which stays untouched as a fallback.

**Core model**
- The logical day runs 07:00 → 07:00, so the Conduent / CMIT / AFC shifts render as
  unbroken blocks in one day column instead of being sliced at midnight.
- Recurring definitions are stored separately from completion state; instances are
  derived at render time and keyed `b:<id>@<date>`, so history cannot duplicate or drift.
- Times are wall-clock minutes from midnight, never UTC.

**Features**
- Today panel: must-do, scheduled tasks, per-employer shift checklists, daily
  non-negotiables with streaks, weekly targets (exercise ×3, learning ×2), appointments,
  and a categorised backlog. Completing an item strikes it through and sinks it.
- Week grid with four fixed lanes per day (Life / Conduent / CMIT / AFC), free-time
  shading, a now-line, and red hatching wherever two lanes collide.
- Conflict and free-time engine. Reports the arithmetic plainly: Monday is 28h scheduled
  inside 24h, 9h15m double-booked, largest free run 7am–12:15pm, below the 7h rest target.
  The permanent AFC × CMIT overlap is 450 min/night.
- Quick-add with a small grammar (`Dentist 3pm-4pm #life !`), editor dialog, delete with
  6-second undo, per-occurrence skip/retime, and "this and all future" for recurring edits.
- JSON export/import with a pre-import snapshot, local-storage backup copy, and a
  recovery banner if the saved state is unreadable.
- Light/dark themes. All 142 text elements measured at ≥4.5:1 contrast in both.

**Seeded** with David's real schedule from `Usual Daily Schedule.docx`, the 8 daily
habits, and the 21 open tasks carried over from `dayflow-data.json` (the 4 completed
ones were dropped).

**Verification:** built-in self-check panel at `?debug=1` runs 41 assertions over the
date maths, overlap detection, streaks, and the quick-add parser — 41/41 passing.

**Also added:** `workflows/dashboard-usage.md`, `workflows/dashboard-maintenance.md`,
`backups/README.md`.
